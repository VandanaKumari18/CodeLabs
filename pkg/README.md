# Pkg Directory

This directory contains shared, reusable code that is designed to be used across different parts of the project or even in other projects. The  directory holds functionality that is modular and not specific to any one part of the application.

### **Purpose**
The purpose of the  directory is to provide generic, utility-level code that can be reused in various parts of the application.

### **Examples:**
-  Contains helper functions like date formatting, string manipulation, or data validation.
-  A package that provides logging functionality for tracking events and errors across the application.
-  Contains custom error types and handling mechanisms to improve error reporting and recovery.

### **Best Practices:**
- Keep functionality independent and reusable.
- Avoid application-specific logic in this directory.
- Any code in this directory should be generic enough that it can be shared across multiple applications or services in the project.
