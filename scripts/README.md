# Scripts Directory

This directory contains various utility scripts used for tasks such as building, testing, deployment, and code generation. These scripts are intended to automate common and repetitive tasks, improving the overall development workflow and reducing the chances for human error.

### **Purpose**
The purpose of the  directory is to hold scripts that assist developers in setting up, testing, and deploying the application. These scripts make the development process more efficient by automating tasks that would otherwise be done manually.

### **Examples:**
-  A script to compile the Go application and generate executables.
-  A script to run all the unit and integration tests in the project.
-  A script to deploy the application to staging or production environments.
-  A script to run code linters and enforce coding standards.

### **Best Practices:**
- Keep scripts simple and reusable.
- Document each script with clear instructions on what it does and how to use it.
- Ensure scripts are version-controlled and easily accessible for all developers in the team.
