# Docs Directory

This directory contains all the project documentation, including technical design, project architecture, development guidelines, and other resources that help developers understand and contribute to the project. The `docs` directory serves as a central place for any kind of documentation related to the project.

### **Purpose**
The purpose of the `docs` directory is to provide clear, well-organized, and accessible documentation to help both current and future developers understand the project structure, how to contribute, and the project's overall goals and functionality.

### **Examples of Files in docs:**
- `architecture.md`: Describes the overall architecture of the project, including high-level components and how they interact.
- `design.md`: Detailed documentation of the system design, data flow, and core components of the application.
- `getting_started.md`: A guide for new developers on how to set up the development environment and run the application locally.
- `contributing.md`: A guide for contributing to the project, including the process for reporting issues, submitting code, and maintaining coding standards.
- `api_documentation.md`: Provides detailed information about the API endpoints, request/response formats, and how to interact with the backend.

### **Best Practices:**
- Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves.
- Organize documentation logically (e.g., separate guides, architecture, and API documentation).
- Ensure the documentation is clear and easy to understand for both technical and non-technical users.
- Make sure to include any important context, assumptions, and dependencies that might affect the understanding of the project.

### **Why Itâ€™s Important:**
- Good documentation enhances collaboration and ensures that every team member, new or existing, can quickly understand the project.
- It reduces the learning curve for new developers, especially interns or new contributors, by providing clear explanations and guides.
- Comprehensive documentation serves as a long-term resource for future developers who will work on the project.
