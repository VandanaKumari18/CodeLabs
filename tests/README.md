# Tests Directory

This directory contains all test-related files, including unit tests, integration tests, and any other tests required to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application.

### **Purpose**
The purpose of the  directory is to provide a comprehensive suite of tests that validate the functionality and performance of the application. Proper testing ensures that code changes do not introduce errors or regressions into the system.

### **Types of Tests:**
-  Contains tests for individual components or units of the application. These tests isolate the smallest functional parts and check their correctness.
-  These tests verify that different components of the application work together as expected. They are broader and ensure that the interactions between modules or services behave correctly.
-  Sample data that is used to run tests, mock responses, and simulate various scenarios.
- Each application will have it's own test file. This will be used as common test file for the whole server.

### **Best Practices:**
- Write tests that are easy to maintain and understand.
- Test both the expected behaviors and edge cases.
- Use mocking frameworks and test doubles to simulate external dependencies and avoid calling real services in unit tests.
